 # HEDERA LIBRARY SYSTEM
 
 ## Introduction
 
 ## Goals
 - Using Public Library systems as a point of trust/KYC/privacy for on-chain transactions
 - Integrating with existing ILS systems, in this case Sierra.
 - Querying an existing ILS for membership and item metadata, and using it for on-chain transactions
 - Tokenize a library item metadata, and transferring it in between two branches, which have their own ethereum address
 - Record item metadata on chain, to be queried by other libraries running this application
