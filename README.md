#D.A.L. - Decentralized Autonomous Library
Inter-Library Loans over The Blockchain
## Overview
Public Libraries using something called Inter-Library Loans.  This is when one Public Libary System requests an item from another Public Library System.  Any search done on membership info, item data, etc is done through and ILS (Integrated Library System). There only is a handful of ILS software providers.

These vendors often run on slow, expensive, and outdated software because they know they have a captive market. By querying these systems, we can start to track real-world assets on the blockchain.

This becomes especially handy when one library loans out their materials to another library. By using the DAL, we can allow these organizations to track an item's Title, Author, Availability, and other metadata along their supply chain.
